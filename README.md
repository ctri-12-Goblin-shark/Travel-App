# Travel-App
This is our Travel App. 

We have created this application using a React frontend and Express in the backend. We have modularized our components in the front end and utilized React Router and React Hooks to facilitate communication between our frontend components. In the backend, we used Express middleware functions to handle concurrent API calls with an algorithm that translates a user inputted budget into an allocated spending plan that accounts for flight costs, hotel prices, and rental cars according to preferences inputted by the user.
